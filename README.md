# Phishing Website Detection System



---

## Overview

The Phishing Website Detection System is a full-stack machine learning web application that analyzes URLs in real time and predicts whether a website is **safe or a phishing threat**. It combines a trained ML model with live external threat intelligence from the **VirusTotal API** and an additional **clickjacking vulnerability check** — giving a three-layer verdict on every URL submitted.

Users enter a URL into a clean web interface, click Submit, and instantly receive a prediction: phishing or safe.

---

## What It Does

- Accepts a URL input through a browser-based web form
- Decodes Base64-encoded URLs before analysis (a common obfuscation trick used by phishing links)
- Runs the URL through a trained **Logistic Regression ML model** that was built on 549,346 real URLs
- Cross-checks the URL against **VirusTotal's** database of known malicious URLs via their API
- Checks the live website's HTTP headers for **missing clickjacking protections** (`X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`)
- Returns a final verdict: **Phishing** (if any single check flags it) or **Safe** (if all three checks pass)

---

## Features

- **Three-layer detection** — ML model + VirusTotal API + clickjacking header check
- **Base64 URL decoding** — catches obfuscated phishing links before analysis
- **Live VirusTotal integration** — cross-references URLs against a real threat intelligence database
- **Clickjacking detection** — checks whether the target site is missing `X-Frame-Options` or `frame-ancestors` CSP headers
- **Two trained models** — Logistic Regression (96% accuracy, deployed) and Multinomial Naive Bayes (saved as backup)
- **Persistent model storage** — trained models saved as `.pkl` files with Pickle, no retraining needed on startup
- **Responsive web UI** — built with Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap 5, mobile-friendly
- **Flask web server** — lightweight Python backend, easy to run locally

## How It Works — Detection Pipeline

```
User submits URL
       │
       ▼
Step 1 — Base64 Decode
       Detects and decodes base64-encoded URLs (common phishing obfuscation)
       │
       ▼
Step 2 — ML Model Prediction
       URL is cleaned → vectorized via CountVectorizer → passed to Logistic Regression
       Returns: 'good' or 'bad'
       │
       ▼
Step 3 — VirusTotal API Check
       URL submitted to VirusTotal v3 API → malicious engine count checked
       Returns: True (malicious) or False (clean)
       │
       ▼
Step 4 — Clickjacking Header Check
       Live GET request to the URL → checks X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy headers
       Returns: True (vulnerable) or False (protected)
       │
       ▼
Final Verdict
       ANY check = bad → "This is a Phishing Website"
       ALL checks = good → "This is a healthy and Safe Website !!"
```

## Machine Learning Pipeline (Notebook)

The model was built in a Jupyter Notebook (`Phishing_Website_detection_system.ipynb`) through the following steps:

### 1. Data Loading
Loaded `phishing_site_urls.csv` containing 549,346 URLs labeled `good` or `bad`.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Checked dataset shape, null values, and label distribution
- Dataset breakdown: **392,924 good** URLs, **156,422 bad** URLs
- Generated Word Cloud visualizations separately for good and bad URLs to identify common patterns

### 3. Text Preprocessing
URLs are text data and must be converted to a numeric form the model can process:

| Step | What it does | Library |
|---|---|---|
| **Tokenization** | Extracts only alphabetical words from the URL, strips numbers and special characters | `nltk.RegexpTokenizer` |
| **Stemming** | Reduces words to their root form (e.g. "login" → "login", "logging" → "log") | `SnowballStemmer` |
| **Join** | Rejoins stemmed tokens into a single string per URL | Python string join |

### 4. Vectorization
`CountVectorizer` converts the processed text into a bag-of-words numerical matrix — a format ML algorithms can read.

### 5. Train/Test Split
80% training / 20% test split using `train_test_split`.

### 6. Model Training & Evaluation

| Model | Test Accuracy | Train Accuracy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Logistic Regression** | **96%** | **97%** | Deployed in Flask app (`phishing.pkl`) |
| **Multinomial Naive Bayes** | Trained | Trained | Saved as backup (`phishing_mnb.pkl`) |

- Minimal gap between train and test accuracy confirms **no overfitting**
- Full classification report and confusion matrix heatmap generated with seaborn

### 7. Model Saving
Both models and the CountVectorizer saved via Pickle for use in the Flask app:
```
phishing.pkl       ← Logistic Regression model
phishing_mnb.pkl   ← Naive Bayes model
Vectorizer.pkl     ← CountVectorizer (must match the model)
```

### Backend — `app.py`

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `decode_base64_url(url)` | Detects base64 data URIs in the URL and decodes them before analysis |
| `check_virustotal(url, api_key)` | Submits URL to VirusTotal v3 API, retrieves malicious engine count |
| `check_clickjacking(url)` | Makes a GET request to the URL and inspects security headers |
| `index()` route | Handles GET (render form) and POST (run full detection pipeline) |

## Dataset

**File:** `phishing_site_urls.csv`

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Total URLs | 549,346 |
| Good (legitimate) URLs | 392,924 |
| Bad (phishing) URLs | 156,422 |
| Columns | `URL`, `Label` |
| Label values | `good`, `bad` |

Sample rows:
```
URL                                                  Label
nobell.it/70ffb52d079109dca5664cce6f317373782/...   bad
youtube.com/watch?v=qI0TQJI3vdU                     good
serviciosbys.com/paypal.cgi.bin.get-into.herf...    bad
```

The dataset contains a mix of real phishing URLs and legitimate website URLs, with a roughly 70/30 split in favor of legitimate sites.

## Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.8+

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/phishing-detection.git
cd phishing-detection
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install flask scikit-learn nltk requests pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn wordcloud
```

### 3. Set up your VirusTotal API key

Get a free API key from [virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com) → Profile → API Key.

Open `app.py` and replace the placeholder:

```python
VT_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_here"
```

> **Note:** The free VirusTotal API tier allows 4 requests per minute. The app will still work without a valid key but the VirusTotal check will fail silently.

### 4. Ensure model files are present

The following files must be in the same directory as `app.py`:

```
phishing.pkl
Vectorizer.pkl
phishing_mnb.pkl   (optional backup)
```

These are pre-trained — no need to retrain unless you want to update the model.

### 5. Place the HTML template

The `index.html` file must be inside a `templates/` folder (Flask convention):

```bash
mkdir templates
mv index.html templates/
```

---

## Usage

### Run the web app

```bash
python3 app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Using the interface

1. Enter any URL in the input field (e.g. `http://suspicious-login.com/paypal`)
2. Click **Submit**
3. The result appears on the page:
   -  `This is a healthy and Safe Website !!`
   -  `This is a Phishing Website`

### Retrain the model (optional)

Open and run `Phishing_Website_detection_system.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook. Ensure `phishing_site_urls.csv` is in the same directory. The notebook will re-generate `phishing.pkl`, `phishing_mnb.pkl`, and `Vectorizer.pkl`.

```bash
jupyter notebook Phishing_Website_detection_system.ipynb
```

---

## Detection Logic

The final verdict is determined by combining all three checks:

```python
if predict == 'bad' or vt_malicious or clickjack_risk:
    result = "This is a Phishing Website"
elif predict == 'good' and not vt_malicious and not clickjack_risk:
    result = "This is a healthy and Safe Website !!"
```

A URL is flagged as phishing if **any one** of the three signals is triggered — making the system conservative and erring on the side of user safety.

---

## What Vulnerabilities / Threats It Detects

| Threat | Detection Method |
|---|---|
| **Phishing URLs** | ML model trained on 549K labeled URLs (96% accuracy) |
| **Known malicious URLs** | VirusTotal API — checks against 70+ antivirus/security engines |
| **Base64 obfuscated links** | Decoded before analysis — catches disguised phishing URLs |
| **Clickjacking risk** | Missing `X-Frame-Options` or `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors` headers |
